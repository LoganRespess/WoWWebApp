# The WoW WebApp

## What is the purpose?
The purpose of this project is to see what I can achieve using a Blizzard API key in my freetime. I wanted a place where I could learn some ways to use public APIs to create apps and have always wanted to make a few conversion tables in excel for the AH. Right now, I plan on using the MERN stack since I have a little bit of time in React and Express. I don't know much about MongoDB so that will be a learning curve.
